# Discrimination_Prediction
In this Data Analysis project, a SAS code is developed to define a logistic regression model to predict discrimination in hiring people in academic environment. A dataset is provided including the information of people like Gender, Years of Education, and Years of Experience. These information is associated with the hiring status of each person. The developed model can predict based on these three factors, a person can be employed in an academic environment based on the developed logistic regression model. For men, Gender number is 1 and for women is 0. The hiring status of 1 shows that the person is hired now and 0 means he/she is unemployed.
